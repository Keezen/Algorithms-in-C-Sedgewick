# solutions

This is my first repository on GitHub, I am going to put the solutions to *Algorithms in C* in it.

##About the book

*Algorithms in C* is an introductory algorithm book by *Robert Sedgewick*. The one I refer to is the Parts 1-4 of it, which is about fundamentals, data structures, sorting and searching. And these solutions are corresponding to the third edition of the book.

##About the solutions

1. These solutions are divided by chapters, and each chapter has two parts, one is the basic routine, and the other is exercise.
2. Most solutions included in this repository are coding programs in the C programming language. Some of them are declarative, which are mostly datas of the algorithm analytic problems.
3. A small fraction of the exercises is not given the solutions in this repository, somtimes it is because the problem is simple enough, and sometimes it is because it is too hard for me to work it out. I don't think I can solve every problem at one time. But it is necessary to think about most of the exercises, and they may give you some useful ideas about the texts that you don't understand completely. I don't touch the problems marked with two black dots before it, some you won't find the solutions to them in this repository, but you can try to solve them.
4. The implementations of basic routines may be different from the text in this repository. The main purpose of doing so is to provide a complete implementation of the function. Sometimes the implementations of the interface are not given, but you can find them in the former solutions.

##Something else

If you have any idea or complaint about this solution, welcome to email me: dxy950608@outlook.com. That is all. Hope it will help a little. Thanks.
