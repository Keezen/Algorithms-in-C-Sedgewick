# Solutions to *Algorithms in C*

This is my first repository on GitHub, I am going to put the solutions to *Algorithms in C* in it.

##About the book

*Algorithms in C* is an introductory algorithm book by *Robert Sedgewick*. The one I refer to is the Parts 1-4 of it, which is about fundamentals, data structures, sorting and searching. And these solutions are corresponding to the third edition of the book.

##About the solutions

1. These solutions are divided by **chapters**, and each chapter has two parts, one is the basic routine, and the other is exercise.
2. Most solutions included in this repository are coding programs in the C programming language.
3. A small part of the exercises is not given the solutions in this repository, somtimes it is because the problem is simple enough, and sometimes it is because it is too hard for me to work it out. But it is necessary to think about most of the exercises, and they may give you some useful inspirations about what you don't understand completely. I don't touch the problems marked with two black dots before it, you won't find the solutions to them in this repository, but you can try to solve them.
4. The implementations of basic routines may be different from that of the text in this repository. The main purpose of doing so is to provide a complete implementation.

##Something else

If you have any idea or suggestion about this solution, welcome to email me: dxy950608@outlook.com. Hope it will help a little.
