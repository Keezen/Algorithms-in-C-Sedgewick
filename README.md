My first repository on GitHub, I am going to put the solutions to Algorithms in C in it.

About Algorithms in C

Algorithms in C is an introductory algorithm book by Robert Sedgewick. The one I refer to is the Parts 1-4 of it, which is about fundamentals, data structures, sorting and searching. And these solutions are corresponding to the third edition.
