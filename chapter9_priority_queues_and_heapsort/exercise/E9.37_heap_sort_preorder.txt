/*
** It seems that the two numbers of every line are nearly the same.
** That is the truth, because we only count the number of comparisons.
** But in fact the pre-order implementation of heapsort takes much more
** runtime than the standard version so that it can't get results when
** N=1,000,000 (maybe it is the problem of the awful implementation). So
** it is highly suggested that you shouldn't use the pre-order implementation.
